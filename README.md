# Introduction

For this project, we will be collecting job postings related to various Data Science openings across the US and using this information to create database of skills desired by employers. 

In this project we go through the process of analyzing data we have scraped from various job search engines. First obtaining the raw data from our sources: 
LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, Simply Hired, and Monster. Once we are able to scrape the data from these main hubs we are able to then clean and tidy.
